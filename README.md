# **Introduction**

In this notebook it is shown the code created to simulate Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloys (FSMA).
Through minimization of the free energy density at different strenghts of magnetic field, we were able to simulate the magnetization reversal of thin films and rolled-up Nanomembranes of Ni$_2$MnGa.
